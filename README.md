# **Face Mask Detection using NVIDIA Jetson Nano**

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **real-time face mask detection** using **Deep Learning** and deployment on the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**. The system detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not from live video streams or images. It leverages **TensorFlow, OpenCV, and EfficientNetB0** for accurate classification and real-time inference.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect faces with and without masks in real-time.
* Build an **affordable and portable solution** using the Jetson Nano.
* Use **transfer learning** with EfficientNetB0 for faster training and better accuracy.
* Deploy the trained model on an **edge device** (Jetson Nano) for practical applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
* **Model**: EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning)
* **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
* **Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano, USB Camera / ESP32-CAM
* **Dataset**: Face Mask Detection Dataset (with images of people wearing and not wearing masks)
